# Lesson 8: Importing Data from the Internet

Welcome to Lesson 8 of our Python Data Science journey! In this lesson, we'll explore the exciting world of importing data from the Internet. As a data scientist, you often need to retrieve data from various online sources, and Python provides powerful tools to help you with this task.

## Lesson Content

### 1. Importing Flat Files from the Web

#### Introduction to Importing Flat Files
In this section, we'll start by learning how to import data from flat files found on the web. We'll cover various methods to read and manipulate these files using Python.

#### Importing Flat Files Using NumPy
We'll use NumPy, a fundamental Python library for numerical computing, to import and work with flat files. You'll learn how to load data, skip rows, specify delimiters, and more.

#### Importing Flat Files Using Pandas
Pandas, the Swiss Army knife of data manipulation, will be your tool of choice for handling data from the web. We'll explore how to load data into Pandas DataFrames and work with it efficiently.

### 2. Importing Data from Other File Types

#### Introduction to Other File Types
Not all data on the web is in CSV format. We'll discuss various file types you might encounter and how to import them into Python.

#### Importing SAS/Stata Files Using Pandas
You'll learn how to work with data stored in SAS and Stata file formats, common in statistical and data analysis fields.

#### Importing HDF5 Files
HDF5 is a file format used for large datasets. We'll see how to access and manipulate HDF5 files using Python.

#### Importing MATLAB Files
Matlab is a popular environment for engineering and scientific applications. We'll explore how to import data saved in Matlab's format into Python.

### 3. Working with Relational Databases in Python

#### Creating a Database Engine in Python
Relational databases are the backbone of many data-driven applications. We'll cover the basics of creating a database engine in Python and how to interact with it.

#### Querying Relational Databases in Python
You'll learn how to query databases using SQL (Structured Query Language) within Python. We'll cover various types of queries, filtering, sorting, and more.

#### Querying Relational Databases Directly with Pandas
Pandas provides a convenient way to query relational databases directly. We'll explore how to retrieve data from a database using Pandas.

#### Advanced Querying: Exploiting Table Relationships
In this section, we'll dive deeper into relational databases, exploring how to work with multiple tables and exploit relationships between them.
