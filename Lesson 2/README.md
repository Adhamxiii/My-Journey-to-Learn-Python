# My Journey to Learn Python - Lesson 2

Welcome to the documentation for **Lesson 2** of my journey to learn Python! In this lesson, I'll be diving into the topic of **Slicing and Indexing** and **Creating and Visualizing DataFrames** using the powerful pandas library.

## Lesson Content

### Slicing and Indexing

#### Explicit Indexes

- Introduction to explicit indexes in pandas DataFrames.
- Utilizing `set_index()` and `reset_index()` to modify the DataFrame's index.
- Working with multi-level or hierarchical indexes using `set_index()` with multiple columns.
- Sorting indexes using `sort_index()`.

#### Slicing and Subsetting with `.loc` and `.iloc`

- Performing slicing and subsetting using `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]` methods.
- Using these methods to filter and retrieve specific rows and columns.

### Working with Pivot Tables

- Introduction to pivot tables for summarizing data.
- Creating pivot tables using the `pivot_table()` function.
- Calculating statistics for grouped data using pivot tables.

### Creating and Visualizing DataFrames

#### Visualizing Your Data

- Visualizing data using various plot types: bar, line, scatter, and histograms.
- Analyzing changes in sales over time and supply-demand relationships.
- Differentiating visualization techniques based on data types and goals.

### Missing Values

- Identifying missing values using `isna()` and `isna().any()` methods.
- Handling missing values by dropping or replacing them.

#### Creating DataFrames

- Creating DataFrames using dictionaries from a list of dictionaries or a dictionary of lists.
