# Lesson 9: Cleaning Data in Python

Welcome to Lesson 9 of our Python Data Science journey! In this lesson, we'll dive into the essential topic of data cleaning. Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process, as it ensures that your data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

## Lesson Content

### 1. Common Data Problems

#### Data Type Constraints
We'll begin by exploring data type constraints. You'll learn how to identify and address issues related to data types, ensuring that your data is correctly represented in Python.

#### Data Range Constraints
Data often comes with constraints on valid values or ranges. We'll discuss how to handle data that falls outside these constraints, making it suitable for analysis.

#### Uniqueness Constraints
Data should be unique, but duplicates can sneak in. We'll cover methods to detect and eliminate duplicate records, ensuring your data is clean and accurate.

### 2. Text and Categorical Data Problems

#### Membership Constraints
Sometimes data contains categories or labels that shouldn't be there. We'll discuss how to identify and handle these unexpected values.

#### Categorical Variables
Categorical variables require special attention. We'll explore techniques to clean and standardize categorical data for analysis.

#### Remapping Categories
Data cleaning might involve remapping or recategorizing variables to make them more meaningful. We'll demonstrate how to achieve this efficiently.

### 3. Advanced Data Problems

#### Uniformity
Uniformity is key to data consistency. We'll show you how to ensure uniformity across your dataset, improving its quality.

#### Completeness
Incomplete data can hinder your analysis. We'll discuss methods to handle missing data, ensuring your dataset is complete and ready for analysis.
