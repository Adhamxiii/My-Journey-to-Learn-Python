# My Journey to Learn Python

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey to learn Python! In this repository, I'll be sharing my progress, lessons, and code as I embark on the exciting adventure of learning Python programming.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Data Manipulation with pandas

Pandas is the world's most popular Python library, used for everything from data manipulation to data analysis. In this lesson, I've covered the following topics:

#### Transforming Data

- Introduction to Dataframes and their importance in pandas.
- Importing data using `pd.read_csv()` and inspecting data with various methods.
- Understanding parts of a DataFrame: columns, index, and values.
- Sorting and subsetting data using `sort_values()` and conditionals.
- Creating new columns to derive insights from the data.

#### Aggregating Data

- Calculating summary statistics using built-in and custom functions.
- Counting unique values and handling duplicates.
- Grouping data and calculating group-wise summary statistics using `groupby()`.
- Introducing pivot tables for alternate data summarization.

I'm excited to continue my learning journey and dive deeper into the world of Python programming. Stay tuned for more updates and lessons!
