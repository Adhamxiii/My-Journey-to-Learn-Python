# My Journey to Learn Python

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey to learn Python! In this repository, I'll be sharing my progress, lessons, and code as I embark on the exciting adventure of learning Python programming.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Data Manipulation with pandas

Pandas is the world's most popular Python library, used for everything from data manipulation to data analysis. In this lesson, I've covered the following topics:

#### Transforming Data

- Introduction to Dataframes and their importance in pandas.
- Importing data using `pd.read_csv()` and inspecting data with various methods.
- Understanding parts of a DataFrame: columns, index, and values.
- Sorting and subsetting data using `sort_values()` and conditionals.
- Creating new columns to derive insights from the data.

#### Aggregating Data

- Calculating summary statistics using built-in and custom functions.
- Counting unique values and handling duplicates.
- Grouping data and calculating group-wise summary statistics using `groupby()`.
- Introducing pivot tables for alternate data summarization.

I'm excited to continue my learning journey and dive deeper into the world of Python programming. Stay tuned for more updates and lessons!

### Lesson 2: Slicing and Indexing, Creating and Visualizing DataFrames

In Lesson 2, I've explored essential techniques for slicing and indexing data in pandas DataFrames. I've also delved into the creation and visualization of DataFrames, gaining insights through visual representations of the data.

#### Slicing and Indexing

- Understanding explicit indexes and their significance.
- Using `set_index()` and `reset_index()` to modify DataFrame indexes.
- Working with multi-level or hierarchical indexes.
- Slicing and subsetting with `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]` methods.
- Working with pivot tables to summarize data and calculate statistics.

#### Creating and Visualizing DataFrames

- Visualizing data using various plot types such as bar, line, scatter, and histograms.
- Analyzing changes in sales over time and supply-demand relationships.
- Handling missing values using `isna()` and `isna().any()` methods.

### Lesson 3: Joining Data with Pandas

In Lesson 3, I've delved into the art of joining and merging data using pandas. This lesson covers:

- Basic data merging with inner joins and one-to-many relationships.
- Merging multiple DataFrames effectively and handling different join types.
- Advanced techniques such as filtering joins and merging ordered/time-series data.

### Lesson 5: Introduction to Data Visualization with Seaborn

In Lesson 5, I delve into **Data Visualization with Seaborn**, an essential skill to communicate insights from data effectively. Here's a summarized overview of the lesson:

- **Introduction to Seaborn**: Explore the significance of data visualization and the advantages of using Seaborn for creating appealing visualizations.

- **Visualizing Quantitative Data**: Learn to create scatter plots to depict numerical relationships and utilize count plots to visualize categorical data distribution.

- **Combining Pandas with Seaborn**: Integrate Seaborn with Pandas DataFrames, enhance visualizations using hue, size, and style parameters.

- **Visualizing Multivariate Data**: Use `relplot()` for subplots and explore relationships between quantitative variables with customized scatter plots.

- **Visualizing Categorical and Quantitative Data**: Utilize count plots, bar plots, box plots, and point plots to represent categorical and quantitative relationships.

- **Styling and Customizing Visualizations**: Change plot styles, contexts, and customize visual elements for enhanced aesthetics.

- **Crafting Comprehensive Visualizations**: Apply skills to create c'omplex visualizations with real-world data by combining various Seaborn functions.

### Lesson 6: Bringing it all together

In Lesson 6, we consolidate our understanding of Python by covering advanced topics and techniques. This lesson brings together the knowledge gained in previous lessons and applies it to real-world scenarios.

- **Writing Your Own Functions:** Learn how to create user-defined functions, handle multiple parameters and return values, and apply functions to practical examples.

- **Default Arguments, Variable-length Arguments, and Scope:** Dive into the use of default arguments in functions, managing variable-length argument lists, and understanding the scope of variables.

- **Lambda Functions and Error Handling:** Explore lambda functions for concise code, and master error handling using try, except, and raise for robust program behavior.

- **Using Iterators in Python:** Understand and work with iterators, including creating custom iterators and generators.

- **List Comprehensions and Generators:** Learn about list comprehensions for efficient list creation and delve into generator expressions for memory-efficient code. Explore advanced comprehensions with conditionals and expression filtering.

- **Bringing It All Together:** Apply your Python skills to a real-world scenario. Learn how to read and analyze data from large files using iterators, leverage pandas' read_csv iterator for streaming data analysis, and visualize data to uncover insights.

### Lesson 7: Intermediate Data Visualization with Seaborn

In Lesson 7, we'll dive deeper into data visualization with Seaborn, building upon the skills acquired in Lesson 5. This lesson will cover:

- **Seaborn Introduction**: A brief overview of Seaborn and its advantages in data visualization.

- **Regression Plots in Seaborn**: Explore regression plots, including `regplot()` and `lmplot()`, for visualizing relationships between variables.

- **Customizing Seaborn Plots**: Learn to customize Seaborn styles, colors, and visual elements to create visually appealing and informative plots.
