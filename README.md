# My Journey to Learn Python

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey to learn Python! In this repository, I'll be sharing my progress, lessons, and code as I embark on the exciting adventure of learning Python programming.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Data Manipulation with pandas

Pandas is the world's most popular Python library, used for everything from data manipulation to data analysis. In this lesson, I've covered the following topics:

#### Transforming Data

- Introduction to Dataframes and their importance in pandas.
- Importing data using `pd.read_csv()` and inspecting data with various methods.
- Understanding parts of a DataFrame: columns, index, and values.
- Sorting and subsetting data using `sort_values()` and conditionals.
- Creating new columns to derive insights from the data.

#### Aggregating Data

- Calculating summary statistics using built-in and custom functions.
- Counting unique values and handling duplicates.
- Grouping data and calculating group-wise summary statistics using `groupby()`.
- Introducing pivot tables for alternate data summarization.

I'm excited to continue my learning journey and dive deeper into the world of Python programming. Stay tuned for more updates and lessons!

### Lesson 2: Slicing and Indexing, Creating and Visualizing DataFrames

In Lesson 2, I've explored essential techniques for slicing and indexing data in pandas DataFrames. I've also delved into the creation and visualization of DataFrames, gaining insights through visual representations of the data.

#### Slicing and Indexing

- Understanding explicit indexes and their significance.
- Using `set_index()` and `reset_index()` to modify DataFrame indexes.
- Working with multi-level or hierarchical indexes.
- Slicing and subsetting with `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]` methods.
- Working with pivot tables to summarize data and calculate statistics.

#### Creating and Visualizing DataFrames

- Visualizing data using various plot types such as bar, line, scatter, and histograms.
- Analyzing changes in sales over time and supply-demand relationships.
- Handling missing values using `isna()` and `isna().any()` methods.

Stay tuned for more as I continue to enhance my Python skills and explore new concepts!

### Lesson 3: Joining Data with Pandas

In Lesson 3, I've delved into the art of joining and merging data using pandas. This lesson covers:
- Basic data merging with inner joins and one-to-many relationships.
- Merging multiple DataFrames effectively and handling different join types.
- Advanced techniques such as filtering joins and merging ordered/time-series data.

### Lesson 4: Advanced Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Building upon the previous lesson, I've delved deeper into data visualization techniques using Matplotlib. This lesson covers customizing plots, plotting time-series data, quantitative comparisons, and sharing visualizations.


Stay tuned for more lessons as I continue my journey to master Python programming!
